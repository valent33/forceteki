/**
 * Subclass of {@link TargetedCostAdjuster} for effects that allow defeating resources to reduce a card's cost (e.g. Greater Sarlacc).
 *
 * The key difference from other targeted adjusters is that the targets are themselves resources, so defeating a ready resource
 * also leaves one fewer resource available to pay the remaining cost. This is tracked by reserving the consumed resources
 * on the adjusted cost, so that payability checks account for them.
 *
 * Since players may rearrange their resources at any time before one is chosen, the player may select any of their resources and
 * the chosen resources are then rearranged into the best state for the effect before being defeated: ready if the effect requires
 * ready resources, otherwise exhausted (so that as many ready resources as possible remain to pay with).
