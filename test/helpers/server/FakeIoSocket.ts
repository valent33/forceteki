 * (`GameServer.authenticateSocketAsync` / `handleSocketConnectionAsync` / `onConnectionAsync`, and
 * everything `Lobby` registers on the socket afterwards) without a real network connection.
 *
 * Two independent directions of traffic are modelled:
 *
 * - **Inbound** (client -> server): production code calls {@link on} to register a handler for an
 *   event sent by the client (`'game'`, `'lobby'`, `'disconnect'`, `'manualDisconnect'`, `'requeue'`).
 *   A test drives this traffic with {@link simulateClientEmit}, which looks up and invokes whatever
 *   was registered - exactly as a real socket.io socket would dispatch an incoming packet to the
 *   handler the server code registered.
 *
 * - **Outbound** (server -> client): production code calls {@link emit} to send data to the client.
 *   Rather than really transmitting anything, this just records the call in {@link emittedEvents} for
 *   a test (via `TestClient`'s inbox) to read back.
